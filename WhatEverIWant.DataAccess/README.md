# Data Access Layer

### TODOS

- How to automate creation of DAL with best practices, code, structure, types (like a plugin, or app, etc.)?

- Maybe database migrations can be moved to separate project

- Maybe Generic Repositories will be deleted later because no need to support all databases, especially NoSQL for those apps (Sqlite, Postgres, MariaDb, MSSQL are mostly enough).
